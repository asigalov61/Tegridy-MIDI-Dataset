## Easily decode to MIDI with tegridy-tools TMIDIX Python module like so:

```sh
!git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/asigalov61/tegridy-tools 
```

```python
# Import modules

import TMIDIX
import random

# Load melodies...

clean_melodies, clean_melodies_pitches, clean_melodies_delta_pitches = TMIDIX.Tegridy_Any_Pickle_File_Reader('clean_melodies')

# Decode to MIDI...

song = random.choice(clean_melodies)

for ss in song:

    time += ss[0] * 32

    dur = ss[1] * 32

    pitch = ss[2]

    song_f.append(['note', time, dur, channel, pitch, vel, 0])
